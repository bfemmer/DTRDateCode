The app can be configured (via settings) to calculate surface conveyance date codes in accordance with paragraph B (including the 4-digit codes used for ocean conveyance), and air conveyance hour/day codes in accordance with paragraph C. For air conveyance hour codes, the program takes into account the local timezone. In addition, the app can reverse-calculate dates from an existing date code.
